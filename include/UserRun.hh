// To collect data over worker threads at the end of an event loop, derived class of G4Run should be used. 
// The base class defines the following virtual methods:
// void RecordEvent(const G4Event*)
//      Method to be overwritten by the user for recording events in this (thread-local) run.
//      Invoke G4Run base-class method for recording data member in the base class.
//      If the user in the past has implemented an access to hits or scores in his/her UserEventAction::EndOfEventAction(), 
//      (s)he can simply move that code segment to this RecordEvent() method. See the following sample code.
// void Merge(const G4Run*)
//      Method to be overwritten by the user for merging local Run object to the global Run object.
//      Invoke G4Run base-class method to merge data member in the base class.
